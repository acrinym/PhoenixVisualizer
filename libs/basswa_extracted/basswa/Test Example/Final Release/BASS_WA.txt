What's the point?
=================
BASS_WA is a add-on for the BASS Sound System, BASS_WA allows the usage of Winamp
visual plugins within your applications.


Requirements
============
BASS version 2.x


Using BASS_WA
==========
C/C++, Delphi and Visual Basic APIs are provided, to use BASS_WA with
another language you'll first have to convert the header file. Or, as a
last resort, you could use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress.

For the BASS_WA functions that return strings (char*), VB users should use
the VBStrFromAnsiPtr function to convert the returned pointer into a VB
string.
