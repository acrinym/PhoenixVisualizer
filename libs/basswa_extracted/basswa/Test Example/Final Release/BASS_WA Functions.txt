This document comments each function BASS_WA exports, on some functions it also shows a example on how the function can be used.

---------------------------------------
Some things you may like to know:

Plugin index:
  BASS_WA creates a list of plugins that are loaded from the plugins directory you provide. If you want 'for example' run a plugin, you only 
  have to provide the plugin index number. You can get the list of plugins by calling the 'BASS_WA_LoadVisPlugin' function, then you can use a
  loop to add all the plugins to a list box, the total number of plugins can be found using the 'BASS_WA_GetWinampPluginCount' function.
  The plugin's name  you have to add to the list can be found using the 'BASS_WA_GetWinampPluginInfo' function, note that VB users have to
  convert the pointer returned to a string, this can be done using the 'GetStringFromPointer' function, this function can be found in the VB example 
  provided with BASS_WA. If you are done adding the plugin names to the listbox, you have to call the 'BASS_WA_FreeVisInfo' to free the 
  VisInfo resources.

Module index:
  BASS_WA also creates a list of modules contained in the visual plugin, you can load the module info almost the same way as you load the
  plugin indexes. If you want to display the modules contained in the plugin you have to loop trough all possible modules, the total number of
  modules can be found using the 'BASS_WA_GetModuleCount' funcion. You can for example add the modules to a combo box, this way users 
  can select the module they want to run. The module names can be found using the 'BASS_WA_GetModuleInfo' function, for VB users
  the pointer returned has to be convered to a string using the 'GetStringFromPointer' funtion found in the VB example provided with BASS_WA.
