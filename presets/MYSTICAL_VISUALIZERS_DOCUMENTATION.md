# Mystical Visualizers Documentation

## Overview

This collection of visualizers explores the intersection of ancient mystical knowledge with modern digital visualization technology. Drawing from alchemy, Kabbalah, and the Matrix concept, these visualizers create immersive experiences that blend esoteric wisdom with cutting-edge graphics and real-time audio processing.

## The Mystical Systems

### Alchemy - The Art of Transmutation
