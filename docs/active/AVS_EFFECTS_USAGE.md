## üîß Advanced Usage

### Effect Chain Management
- Effects are processed in sequence
- Each effect can modify the output of the previous effect
- Chain order affects final visual result

### Performance Optimization
- Limit active effects based on your system capabilities
- Use effect categories to focus on specific types
- Monitor frame rate and adjust settings accordingly

### Audio Integration
- Effects automatically receive real-time audio data
- Beat detection for reactive animations
- FFT spectrum and waveform data support

## üéØ Tips and Tricks

### Creating Dynamic Visuals
1. Start with 3-5 effects for good performance
2. Mix different effect types for variety
3. Use beat reactivity for engaging animations
4. Experiment with rotation and spacing

### Performance Optimization
1. Monitor your system's performance
2. Reduce effect count if experiencing lag
3. Disable unnecessary display features
4. Use simpler effects for complex chains

### Creative Combinations
1. **Oscilloscope + Pattern**: Combine scope effects with patterns
2. **Beat + Utility**: Use beat detection with utility effects
3. **Color + Shape**: Mix color transforms with geometric effects

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Effects Not Displaying
- Check that the AVS Effects Engine is selected
